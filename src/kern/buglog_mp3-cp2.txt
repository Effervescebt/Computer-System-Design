I. Kernel runs directly into idle thread and never returned.
->mark as solved
modified plic and set all ctxno to 1, that threads finally stated working

II. Stuck in process exec, fault occured
->mark as solved
didn't set R/W flags before reading elf contents, modified and entered next step

III. Process_exit didn't call reclaim
->mark as solved

*** time consuming bug
IV. User free freed wrong pages, if statements didn't function.
->mark as solved
issue was in bitwise operands. == probably fired earlier than & and |. Added parentheses to all judgements and passed

V. Stuck in thread jump user
->mark as solved
entryptr in process exec when calling thread_jump_to_user was written as "&((uintptr_t *)entryptr)", deleted & and everything worked fine

*** struggling bug
VI. User program tried to allocate stack after elf_load but failed and ran forever. Free list used up.
->mark as solved
memory_handle_page_fault didn't set U_flag for the stack allocated. Hidden case. Set U flag for mapped pages and it worked.

VII. Thread failure during switch & suspend self.
->mark as solved
didn't set tp to the thread_pointer stored in thread_stack_anchor, fixed on line 165 in trapasm.s

VIII. Still thread failure
->mark as solved
process init didn't link process with thread but only did thread to process

IX. After finishing init0, load access fault occured
->mark as solved
deleted the free pt2 line in reclaim, freeing the table cause all kernel image becoming dangling pointers.

X. Running init2, failure in loading device and file
->mark as solved
an if statement telling if io in iotab is NULL fired the bug. Two statements in syscall fsopen and deviceopen deleted and it continued

XI. io NULL after sysdevopen and sysfsopen
->mark as solved
didn't save io after obtaining from two open functions. Fixed twice by adding & and saving into iotab

XII. In syswrite and sysread, wrong if statement judging return value from memory extra credit functions.
->mark as solved

Dec.1 Sun

XIII. Fault occured after trek exiting. Occured in iteration of free_list.
->partially solved
switch to inserting from list head and it worked. Yet issue not spotted, tricky hidden case.
